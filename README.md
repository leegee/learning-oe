# Quiz Lessons: learn Old English or anything

Configurable quiz cards for language learning or other quizes

## Features

* Three types of quiz lessons:
    1. multiple choice
    1. fill in the blanks
    1. match vocabulary
    1. translate a sentence
* Easy to create card-based quiz lessons - [JSON](lessons.json) with [JSON Scheme](./lessons.schema.json)
* Easy to create localisation and configuration in [JSON](app.config.json)
* Easy dev and builds with Vite and Typescript

## Future Work

Create components that can use data from other components.

Eg: a component to create a `VocabMatch` card from all the `answer` fields of a multiple-choice card.

## NB

Any resemblance to other language learning apps  is purely coincidence. 

## Thanks:

* The [Junicode](https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/releases/tag/v2.211) font.
* React + Vite + Typescript
